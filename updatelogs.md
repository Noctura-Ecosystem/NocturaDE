- This is just a simple structure of how the compositor will be made

- It will probably be made in Rust (but c is also an option)
- The compositor has the following functions:-
    - Handles input/output devices
    - Necessary variables (like display, scence...) are stored using attributed (i will use structs in the actual version)
